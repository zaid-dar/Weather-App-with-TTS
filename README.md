# Weather App with TTS

This project is a simple weather application that fetches current weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API and reads the information aloud using text-to-speech (TTS).

## Features
- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieve current weather information from OpenWeatherMap.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Use TTS to read out the weather information.
- **User Input**: Enter the city name to get the weather details.
- **API Key**: Uses an API key to retrieve weather data. For security reasons, my personal API key has been redacted. To use the program, generate your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
